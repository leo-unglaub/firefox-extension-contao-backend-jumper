# Contao Firefox Backend Jumper #

This Firefox/Iceweasel extension allows you to quickly jump into the Contao CMS backend of the current site. You don't have to edit the URL directly and append "/contao". You simply have to press F8.

You can configure the path to your backend and the keybinding directly in the extension. This extension doesn't need a Browser restart.
