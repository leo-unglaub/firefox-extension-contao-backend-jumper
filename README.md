# Contao CMS - Backend jumper
This extension for Mozilla Firefox allows you to jump 
into the Contao CMS backend with just one click. You 
don't have to edit the URL manually and append `/contao/index.php`.

By default the F8 key allows you to open the backend. But you can
change that in the extension settings.

If you want to install this extension, please jump over #
